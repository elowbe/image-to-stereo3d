# README.md for .neu File: image-to-stereo3d.neu

## Overview
This `.neu` file defines a graph of nodes that process image inputs to generate stereo 3D outputs. The system is designed to handle various image processing tasks, including depth sensing, perspective transformations, and stereo visualization.

## Functionality Breakdown

### Inputs
- **Color Image**: A standard RGB or RGBA image.
- **Depth Image**: A monochrome image representing depth information.
- **Tilt-X and Tilt-Y**: Numerical values controlling the horizontal and vertical tilt adjustments for 3D effect.
- **Sync Signal**: A synchronization signal used to align processing steps.

### Outputs
- **Stereo 3D Output**: Combined image with stereo effects applied, including depth and tilt transformations.
- **Error Handling**: System status messages or errors.

## Processing Steps

1. **Depth Application Node**:
   - Applies depth sensing effect to the input images.
   - Adjusts tilt parameters for 3D visualization.

2. **Image Side Stitching**:
   - Combines left and right images into a single output for stereo display.

3. **Conditional Logic**:
   - Uses If-Else conditions based on depth values or boolean inputs to control processing flow.

4. **Modular Processing**:
   - Each node can be individually enabled or disabled, allowing flexible configuration of the processing pipeline.

## Node Overview

### Key Nodes:
1. **DepthApplicationNode**:
   - Processes color and depth images.
   - Applies tilt adjustments for stereo effect.

2. **ImageSideStitchNode**:
   - Combines left and right images into a single output.

3. **IfNode**:
   - Implements conditional logic based on depth or boolean inputs.

4. **NotNode**:
   - Inverts boolean values for condition checking.

5. **MultiplicationNode**:
   - Adjusts tilt parameters by multiplying input values.

## Usage
This system is ideal for applications requiring stereo 3D visualization from monocular or stereo cameras. It can be integrated into systems performing tasks like autonomous navigation, AR/VR, or object recognition where 3D spatial awareness is crucial.

## Configuration
- **Parameters**: Tilt adjustments and synchronization signal can be set via node properties.
- **Error Handling**: Errors are logged for troubleshooting purposes.

## Example Workflow
1. Input color and depth images.
2. Apply depth sensing effect with tilt adjustments.
3. Stitch left and right images for stereo output.
4. Conditionally process based on depth values or boolean inputs.
5. Output the final stereo 3D image or status messages.

This system provides a flexible and modular approach to integrating stereo 3D capabilities into various applications, leveraging graph-based node processing for efficient and scalable solutions.
